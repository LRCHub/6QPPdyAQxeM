Breaking in the future just before the week is up
They can do it but it's going to take some money
Have what you desire if and when you see the fact
They will lead us to the land of milk and honey
Work all day or work all night it's all the same
If you want the pay
Some drive tankers
Some are bankers
Some are workers
Some are not
It is time for a party
Destination for the nation now!
Chorus:
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels
Work now!
Call me in the morning just before the breakfast show
We'll watch TV and analyse the weather
Before we go to work we'll have planned the day ahead
We'll while away the working day together
Work all day or work all night it's all the same
If you want to play
Some are nurses
Some steal purses
Some are workers
Some are not
It is time for a party
Liberation for the nation now!
Chorus
There's a party going on
That's going to change the way we live
But how do we know we've even been invited
Now the invitation's waiting
And the table is reserved
So just play it cool and don't get excited
Work or day or work all night it's all the same
Will we ever change
It's vocation or vacation
Some are workers
Some are not
It is time for a party
Syncopation for the nation now!
Chorus
