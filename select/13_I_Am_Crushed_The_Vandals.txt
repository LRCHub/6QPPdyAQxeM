Oh, I am crushed
And I am devastated
And contemplating suicide
But I don't have the nerve
And what's the rush?
It all should end real soon
And so I'll just keep waiting
And I'll listen to them say
"You've got your life in front you"
And so I must reply
That is just more bad news
'Cause I'd really rather die
Than limp around in agony
Reliving all the tragedies
And face another day

Oh, I am crushed
And I am devastated
And it's something I can't mend
It ain't going away soon

I hurt so much
And I cannot explain it
It seems like there's a purpose but I still don't understand
But that's my luck
So I'll just wait in pain
And though it doesn't help I have to listen to them say
"Keep looking at the bright side"
Oh that just hurts my eyes
And if you really care then you would simply let me die
And leave here with some dignity
But it just keeps on making me face another day

Oh, I am crushed
And I am devastated
And it's something I can't mend
It ain't going away soon

Oh, I am crushed
And I am devastated
And contemplating suicide but I don't have the nerve
And what's the rush?
It all should end real soon
And so I'll just keep waiting and I'll listen to them say
"You've got your life in front you"
And so I must reply
That is just more bad news 'cause I'd really rather die
Than limp around in agony
Reliving all the tragedies and face another day

Oh, I am crushed
