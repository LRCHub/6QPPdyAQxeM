Something I need you to know
Don't want to be a stranger to you
I've been this way all along
Oh baby, I'm a danger to myself
(Ultrasound)
Something I need you to know
Don't want to be a stranger to you
I've been this way all along
Oh baby, I'm a danger to myself
Crushed by an angel (Crushed)
When I, when I, when I, when I was
Crushed by an angel (Crushed)
When I, when I, when I, when I was
I like my medicine strong
You serve it to me how I want it (Five)
You said my karma would come
I see it comin'
Crushed by an angel (Crushed)
When I, when I, when I, when I was
Crushed by an angel (Crushed)
When I, when I, when I, when I was
Learned how to relax
While I relapse
And we dance to the song
As long as the beat lasts
The way it feels
when she looks at you
Different in the way she moves
Look back and recap
On your knee caps
While you ask for a sign
Landed right on your lap
Yeah
Clouds parted and the sky was blue
It's real if you make it true
Crushed by an angel (Crushed)
When I, when I, when I, when I was
Crushed by an angel (Crushed)
When I, when I, when I, when I was
When I was
Crushed
Oh, when I was
