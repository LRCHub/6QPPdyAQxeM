Crushed by the wheels, ooh, ooh
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Work, now

Breaking in the future just before the week is up
They can do it but it's going to take some money
Have what you desire if and when you see the fact
They will lead us to the land of milk and honey

Work all day or work all night, it's all the same
If you want the pay
(But do you really want the pain?)

Some drive tankers, some are bankers
Some are workers, some are not
It is time for a party
Dance to nation, for the nation now

Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels, ooh, ooh

Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Work, now

Call me in the morning just before the breakfast show
We'll watch TV and analyze the weather
Before we go to work, we'll have planned the day ahead
We'll while away the working day together
(While away the working day together)

Work all day or work all night, it's all the same
(Work all day)
If you want to play

Some are nurses, some steal purses
Some are workers, some are not
It is time for a party
Liberation for the nation now

Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels, ooh, ooh

Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Work, now

There's a party going on
That's going to change the way we live
But how do we know we've even been invited?
Now the invitation's waiting and the table is reserved
So just play it cool and don't get excited

Work all day or work all night, it's all the same
(Work all day)
Will we ever change?

It's vocation or vacation
Some are workers, some are not
It is time for a party
Syncopation for the nation now

Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels, ooh, ooh

Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Work, now

Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work, now
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work, now
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work, now

Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work, now

Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels, ooh, ooh

Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Crushed by the wheels of industry
Work, now

There's a party going on
That's going to change the way we live
But how do we know we've even been invited?
