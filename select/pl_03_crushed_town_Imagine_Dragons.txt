I was like that before
When I was a child
Age 5 or 6
Cry not for peace or myself
Crushed town
My mind sinks down
Crushed town
Look in your eyes
Crushed town
Leaving nothing
Flashback
The smell of the blue sky
I can't believe in myself
like before
I could do everything
Now I am not an angel
with broken wings
I had a dream
Now it's failed
I can't be like before
As you said
I'm changed
Crushed town
Leaving nothing
Crushed town
Still believe in
Crushed town
They gave me magic
Crushed town
I can be everything
